How to Access DCS
=================

There are two ways to access DCS:

-  Using the management console

   The DCS provides a web-based management console. To launch the DCS console, create an account on the management console and log in, and then choose **Database** > **Distributed Cache Service** on the homepage. On the DCS console, you can create, restart, and delete DCS instances, and change their passwords.

-  Using APIs

   If you want to integrate DCS into a third-party system for secondary development, use APIs to access DCS. For more information about available APIs, see the *Distributed Cache Service API Reference*.
