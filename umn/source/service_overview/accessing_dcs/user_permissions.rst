User Permissions
================

The public cloud system provides two types of user permissions by default: user management and resource management.

User management refers to the management of users, user groups, and user group rights.

Resource management refers to the control operations that can be performed by users on cloud service resources.

For details, see `Permissions <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/permissions/index.html>`__.
