Does DCS for Redis Provide Backend Management Software?
=======================================================

No. If you wish to query Redis configurations and usage information, use redis-cli. If you wish to monitor DCS Redis instance metrics, go to the Cloud Eye console. For details on how to configure and view the metrics, see :ref:`Monitoring <dcs-ug-0326016>`.
