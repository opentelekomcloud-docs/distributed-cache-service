Why Do Requests Sometimes Time Out in Clients?
==============================================

Occasional timeout errors are normal because of network connectivity and client timeout configurations.

You are advised to include reconnection operations into your service code to avoid service failure if a single request fails.

If timeout errors occur frequently, contact O&M personnel.
