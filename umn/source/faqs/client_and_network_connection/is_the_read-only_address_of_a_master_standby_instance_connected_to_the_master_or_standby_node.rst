Is the Read-only Address of a Master/Standby Instance Connected to the Master or Standby Node?
==============================================================================================

A master/standby DCS Redis 4.0/5.0/6.0 instance has a **Connection Address** and a **Read-only Address**. The connection address is used to connect to the master node of the instance, and the read-only address is used to connect to the standby node of the instance.

For details, see :ref:`architecture of Master/Standby DCS Redis 4.0/5.0/6.0 Instances <cachemasterslave__section5805185095215>`.
