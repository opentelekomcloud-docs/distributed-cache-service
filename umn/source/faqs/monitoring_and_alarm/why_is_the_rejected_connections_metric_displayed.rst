Why Is the Rejected Connections Metric Displayed?
=================================================

If the **Rejected Connections** metric is displayed, check if the number of connected clients exceeds the maximum allowed number of connections of the instances. To check the maximum allowed number of connections, go to the **Parameters** tab page of the instance and check the value of the **maxclients** parameter.
