Why Is Memory of a DCS Redis Instance Unchanged After Data Migration Using Rump, Even If No Error Message Is Returned?
======================================================================================================================

For details on how to use Rump, see the :ref:`Data Migration Guide <dcs-migration-230313>`.

Possible causes:

-  Rump does not support migration to cluster DCS instances.
-  Commands are incorrectly run in Rump.
