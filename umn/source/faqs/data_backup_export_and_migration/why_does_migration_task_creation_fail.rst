Why Does Migration Task Creation Fail?
======================================

Possible causes:

#. The underlying resources are insufficient.
#. The specifications of the ECS used for the migration are insufficient.
#. The memory of the target Redis created before the migration is less than that of the source Redis.

In such cases, contact technical support.
